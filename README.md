# Predicting Forest Fires using Linear, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet Regression

This project uses machine learning to predict the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** using the **Algerian Forest Fire Dataset**. After experimenting with several regression models, **Ridge Regression** produced the best results. The model and scaler were saved using `pickle` and integrated into a lightweight **Flask web app** for interactive predictions.

## Features

* Trained and evaluated multiple regression models: Linear, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet
* Best-performing model: **Ridge Regression**
* Models and Scaler serialized with `pickle`
* Flask web app for real-time FWI predictions
* Feature correlation filtering for cleaner model training
* Visualizations for model evaluation and scatter plots

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Encoded target (`Classes`) as binary
   * Removed highly correlated features (threshold = 0.85)
   * Applied StandardScaler

2. **Model Training**

   * Compared Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet models
   * Evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error** and **RÂ² Score**

3. **Model Selection**

   * Ridge Regression gave the best performance
   * Saved `ridge.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` for deployment
